 This data has LABEL 

We should use classification for that and use something like KNN

* For some data we use scaling for prediction because the diffrence between data is high.
* For data we use standardization 
       (X – μ) / σ
      where X is a normal random variable, μ is the mean of X, and σ is the standard deviation of X.
* Class imbalance in classification problems arises when the number of observations belonging to one class is lower than the other
      Ensemble learning combines multiple models to obtain a robust model and has been prominently used with data augmentation methods to address class imbalance problems.
* Missing data is so important
